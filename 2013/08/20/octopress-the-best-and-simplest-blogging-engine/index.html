        <p>So here is my third attempt to setting up my blog. To be honest, its not really the setting up of blog, rather a promise to myself to keep myself regular at blogging. So the goal was to find a reasonably easier yet a very flexible blogging platform. I was just tired of wordpress and the likes. Being a ruby and nodejs enthusiast (apart from python), my search revolved around these languages, which would give me more power than a PHP based framework (PHP hasn’t caught my interest so far).<br><a id="more"></a><br>Searching on google gave a me a few decent options</p>
<h2 id="Nodejs"><a href="#Nodejs" class="headerlink" title="Nodejs"></a>Nodejs</h2><p><a href="">Wheat</a> – a blogging engine created by Tim Caswell, is one of the oldest Node.js blogging engines available. It takes a folder full of markdown formatted text files from git and renders them as HTML.<br>Scotch – is similar to Wheat in that it renders markdown pages. Unlike Wheat, however, it has a caching system built with the NoSQL datastore Redis.<br>Blacksmith – is another static site generator written in Node.js. Inspired by Jekyll, it aims to be a full content management system for those wanting a baked site.</p>
<h2 id="Ruby"><a href="#Ruby" class="headerlink" title="Ruby"></a>Ruby</h2><p><a href="">Typo</a> – the oldest blogging platform in Rails. It has a full set of features you would expect from such an engine, which include powerful SEO capabilities, full themes, and plug-in extensions.<br><a href="">Jekyll</a> – is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.<br><a href="">Octopress</a> – is an obsessively designed framework for Jekyll blogging. It is easy to configure and easy to deploy.<br>Of the many, the above stood out as options. My criteria of evaluation was + Easy setup + Easy deployment + Easy to configure + Highly customizable</p>
<p>I picked up Octopress, for it fulfilled my criteria very well. Its built in Ruby and and is based on Jekyll (a static site generator). It builds on top of Jekyll by making it ready with template, theme and deployment options, which makes it a very easy to start with. Being built in ruby, its very easy to customize with minimal amount of code needed (thanks to a large array of functionality available on ruby).</p>
<p>The setup was as easy as cloning the octopress repository to my local drive with git and installing dependencies.<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git <span class="built_in">clone</span> git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress</span><br><span class="line">bundle install</span><br><span class="line">rake install</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Once setup it just needs a bit of configuration for setting up your social media accounts, Google analytics account etc in a single file _config.yml. It is self explanatory.</p>
<p>For deployment, of the many choices, I chose to host it on my own server I took on linode. The configuration for deplyment is in Rakefile . For the deplyment option I chose rsync and filled appropriate field in the Rakefile.</p>
<p>And thats it! To build and deploy all you need to do is</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">rake generate</span><br><span class="line">rake deploy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>and voila! its all done.</p>
<p>To add a post or page its as simple as running the following command<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">rake new_post[<span class="string">"My awesome post"</span>]</span><br><span class="line">rake new_page[somefolder/somepage]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>The beauty of this is, it is all done in Markdown syntax which is easy to read as text and also compiles into html. I assured that all my posts are there on my disk as simple readable text files.</p>
<p>Even better part is there are a lot of plugins available for octopress for doing things like adding your twitter info or generating image thumbnails etc. Check it out on the web. For all those who have existing blogs, its super easy to import them. More information on importing here.</p>
<p>With its ease of use I am confident this will be my choice of blogging platform for years to come and will help me fulfill my desire blog more regularly.</p>
<p>Happy hacking the blog engine for hacker !!</p>
